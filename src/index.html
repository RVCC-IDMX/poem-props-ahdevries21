      <p>
        The sun descending in the west,<br>
        The evening star does shine;<br>
        The birds are silent in their nest,<br>
        And I must seek for mine.<br>
        The moon, like a flower<br>
        In heaven's high bower,<br>
        With silent delight,<br>
        Sits and smiles on the night.<br>
        <br>
        Farewell, green fields and happy grove,<br>
        Where flocks have ta'en delight.<br>
        Where lambs have nibbled, silent move<br>
        The feet of angels bright;<br>
        Unseen they pour blessing,<br>
        And joy without ceasing,<br>
        On each bud and blossom,<br>
        And each sleeping bosom.<br>
        <br>
        They look in every thoughtless nest<br>
        Where birds are covered warm;<br>
        They visit caves of every beast,<br>
        To keep them all from harm:<br>
        If they see any weeping<br>
        That should have been sleeping,<br>
        They pour sleep on their head,<br>
        And sit down by their bed.<br>
        <br>
        When wolves and tigers howl for prey,<br>
        They pitying stand and weep;<br>
        Seeking to drive their thirst away,<br>
        And keep them from the sheep.<br>
        But, if they rush dreadful,<br>
        The angels, most heedful,<br>
        Receive each mild spirit,<br>
        New worlds to inherit.<br>
        <br>
        And there the lion's ruddy eyes<br>
        Shall flow with tears of gold:<br>
        And pitying the tender cries,<br>
        And walking round the fold:<br>
        Saying: "Wrath by His meekness,<br>
        And, by His health, sickness,<br>
        Are driven away<br>
        From our immortal day.<br>
        <br>
        "And now beside thee, bleating lamb,<br>
        I can lie down and sleep,<br>
        Or think on Him who bore thy name,<br>
        Graze after thee, and weep.<br>
        For, washed in life's river,<br>
        My bright mane for ever<br>
        Shall shine like the gold,<br>
        As I guard o'er the fold."<br>
